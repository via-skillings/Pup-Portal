## Description
This application is designed to help dog shelter employees with creating new dogs in their database for potential pet parents to view. Employees would enter information about each dog into the database with all important information about the dogs. Once in the database, employees logged in to the database can also view a list of all the current doegs and their information.

Our motivation for this application was an easy way for shelters to add new dogs to their website and allow pet and pet information to be viewed. Many shelters can struggle with keeping current information ready and available for people to view. Hopefully this will help shelters stay up to date on their website so more dogs can be adopted! 

This project allowed our team to use a Model-View Controller file structure, a SQL database, Sequelize, handlebars, and to create API routes. Our team also had the opportunity to practice using Heroku to deploy our application with a working database.

## Usage
Registered users in the database (dog shelter workers) can enter their login credentials by selecting the 'login' link, and then either select the link to view all dogs in the database or add a new dog. Users can select the "home page" button to navigate to the home screen and choose to add/view dogs. When finished, users can select the logout button to log out.

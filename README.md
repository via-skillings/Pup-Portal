## Description
This application is designed to help dog shelter employees with creating new dogs in their database for potential pet parents to view. The information the employees would enter information about each dog into the database with all important information about the dogs.

Our motivation for this application was an easy way for shelters to add new dogs to their website and allow pet and pet information to be viewed. Many shelters can struggle with keeping current information ready and available for people to view. Hopefully this will help shelters stay up to date on their website so more dogs can be adopted!
